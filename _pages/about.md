I am currently an associate professor at the Key Laboratory of Network Data Science and Technology (directed by [Prof. Jiafeng
Guo](http://www.bigdatalab.ac.cn/gjf/)), Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Software and Theory from the ICT, CAS in 2019, under the supervision of [Prof. Xiaolong Jin](http://www.bigdatalab.ac.cn/jxl/). Before that, I gained my B.S. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Beijing University of Chemical Technology in 2014.

My current research interests include **data value enhancement**, **data quality improvement**, **knowledge graph**, etc. Recently, my work has focused on developing explainable and insightful models for data value and data quality improvement. I have published more than 30 papers in prestigious journals and conferences, including TKDE, KAIS, WWW, SIGIR, ACL, etc.
